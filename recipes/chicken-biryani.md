# Chicken Biryani

## Ingredients

### For Marinating Chicken:

- 1 450g chicken pieces (bone-in for better flavor)
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- Salt to taste

### For Rice:

- 1.5 cups basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes
- 4-5 cups water
- 2-3 green cardamom pods
- 2-3 cloves
- 1-inch cinnamon stick
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt to taste

### For Biryani:

- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 2 green chilies, slit
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)
- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped for garnish
- Fresh mint leaves, chopped for garnish

## Preparation

### Marinating the Chicken:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt.

2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.

### Cooking the Rice:

1. In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice along with the green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and salt.

2. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (it should have a slight bite to it). Drain and set aside.

### Making the Biryani:

1. Heat oil or ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or a biryani pot. Add the sliced onions and saute until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnish.

2. In the same pan, add the marinated chicken pieces. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink and starts to brown.

3. Add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes soften.

4. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle the reserved fried onions, fresh coriander leaves, and mint leaves on top.

5. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully cook.

6. Once done, fluff the biryani gently with a fork, mixing the layers.

7. Serve the Chicken Biryani hot, garnished with more fresh mint and coriander leaves.

Enjoy this flavorful and aromatic Chicken Biryani!

Pro tip: You can also add saffron soaked in warm milk or fried cashews and raisins for added richness.
